					<h2>My Experience as Rutgers Chess Club President</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>I’d never thought of myself as someone who could manage anything. In school, I was never one to run for student office or take part in running any aspect of the high school activities and clubs. I always had too much on my plate and I could never find the time to get my own life in order, much less spend time on running an organization.</p>
					<p>That all changed when I came to Rutgers University. Suddenly, I found myself with more time and freedom than I’d ever had. I had a lot of fun in my freshman year of college – until COVID-19 hit. </p>
					<p>Staying at home and bored out of my mind, a friend introduced me to a game that will have forever changed the course of my time at Rutgers. My friend introduced me to the game of chess. I knew the rules already, but I never played much when I was a kid, so I was pretty bad at it when I just started. </p>
					<p>But I played more and more. I felt a rush every game I won and I felt a burning passion to do better every game I lost. Soon, I found myself obsessed with the game, playing a dozen long-form games a day, improving week by week. My newfound obsession would ultimately lead me to the Rutgers Chess Club.</p>

					<h3>Joining the Rutgers Chess Club</h3>
					<p>I joined the club in August of 2021. I found a community of players that I could play chess with, and some of these people were way better than I was. Although it was still online at the time, Rutgers was going back to in-person classes this semester.</p>
					<p>At that same time, the president at the time put out an announcement looking to fill open positions in the club. I applied for the position of Secretary. I had no idea whether I was going to be able to contribute well to the club, but my father encouraged me to try. </p>
					<p>Before I knew it, I was the Secretary of the club. The whole year was filled with lots of different things. I saw first-hand how the president planned all the events for the year. I sat in the room during the Executive Board meetings. Watching and taking notes, I was learning how the President did his job. </p>
					<p>The year quickly as I was finishing up my junior year at Rutgers. At the last Executive Board meeting, the president and vice president of the club met with me. They saw the work I did for the club and decided to transfer the title of President over to me.</p>
					<p>I was thrilled as much as I was terrified. In my mind, there were a dozen people more qualified than I was, who had played chess since they were kids, and who had years more experience managing than I did. But I took up the challenge, and what a year it has been!</p>
					<p>When I was just starting, I found the Rutgers Student Organization & Advisor Handbook page to be especially helpful in learning the ropes of how to manage an organization. To quote a line from the page that summarizes the content listed on it: “We welcome you in your new endeavor as a student organization leader. The information contained in this handbook is meant to serve as a resource to student organizations and their officers. Our hope is to build a partnership with you that will ensure success for your organization” (Rutgers). I come back to this document frequently throughout the year for guidance on what to do.</p>

					<h3>Preparing for the School Year</h3>
					<p>After the previous president transferred all the accounts and information over to me, I knew there was a lot of work I had to do. I had the whole summer to try, but I was also doing a full-time internship at the time, so I had to work quickly before it started.</p>
					<p>I looked at the state of the club’s accounts and logins and there were a whole host of problems that needed to be fixed. For one, all the online accounts weren’t written down anywhere, and most of the social media accounts weren’t updated. </p>
					<p>One by one, I combed through every account that the club had and I wrote them down. For some of them, the club had lost the login for the account, and there was a whole recovery process needed to get it back.</p>
					<p>The Discord server also needed a ton of work. As did the club listing on the student organization registry getINVOLVED. The more I looked, the more I saw what could be improved. I found myself spending hours on end researching and editing all of the club’s information to be as comprehensive as possible for people joining the club.</p>
					<p>Soon after, it was the fall semester. At the time, there were only three people on the Executive Board, almost everyone who was on it previously either graduated or quit the club. I needed to find new people to fill the positions.</p>
					<p>I tried to fill the most critical positions first: Treasurer and Secretary. I met with some of the people who applied and I had to make some tough decisions on who to pick for the role. Looking through their experience, I tried to pick who I thought would be the best suited for the role. </p>

					<h3>Involvement Fair</h3>
					<p>The Involvement fair was one of the biggest events of the semester, and it happened on the first week. All of the clubs at Rutgers, hundreds of clubs spanning every interest imaginable, show what their club is all about. The entire College Avenue was closed and we were right in the middle of it all.</p>
					<p>We arrived about 30 minutes early to set up our flyers and our banner. Then we set up three chess boards and clocks and our three current board members on each board. For the next four hours, we played continuous blitz (short-form) games to the onslaught of people joining our club. We must have gotten around a hundred new signups that day.</p>
					<p>Since the Involvement Fair had gotten moved from that Monday to the Friday due to rain, our first meeting was scheduled right after the fair. At the time, I thought this was a mistake, but to my surprise, it was one of the most popular meetings we had that semester. Nearly 30 people showed up to our first meeting of the semester. </p>
					<p>This was the first meeting I had managed on my own, and it was a taste of what the rest of the semester was going to be like. I was very optimistic about the direction the club was heading it.</p>

					<h3>USATE</h3>
					<p>Another one of the biggest events of the year is US Amateur Team East. The club has been playing in this tournament for several years now and it has always been an exceptional experience. We had received several hundred dollars of funding for this event from Rutgers and we were determined to make it a great event. </p>
					<p>There were a few minor hiccups with the signups, including not having a firm deadline for signups and not knowing how many teams to send and how much to fund each team. Ultimately, we decided to fund all three teams ourselves. </p>
					<p>We ended up sending 12 people to the tournament fully funded by Rutgers, and it became one of my most memorable experiences as President.</p>

					<h3>Rutgers Blitz Tournament</h3>
					<p>We wanted to end the year on a high note, so we organized a free tournament for all Rutgers students. This event was one of the most difficult to organize events of the year. With so many moving parts, this event took several of the board members to organize and plan. And if anything happened, it would be a disaster. </p>
					<p>After weeks of discussions, we booked the rooms and the food. We made flyers and put out announcements for the tournament. I even went home to get my camera equipment to film the whole thing. </p>
					<p>The event ended up as a fantastic success. The club hadn’t run a tournament like this in several years now, so I am very happy to have been the one to bring it back. </p>
					<p>A resource I referenced quite a lot during this time was the US Chess Federation website. It had a lot of information about managing chess organizations and tournaments. I found a lot of the information helpful as I have never run any kind of tournament before. One of the pages there had information about running a chess club: “The local chess club is an important link between the player and other organizations, such as state affiliates and our national chess organization, the US Chess Federation (US Chess). A club introduces members to the fun and benefits of playing chess and can provide exposure to the wider world of competitive chess” (USCF)</p>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>I’m very happy with what I accomplished during my time as President. When I look back, I see where the club was before and where it is now. I firmly believe the club in its 150+ year history has never been in as good a position as it is in now. Even so, there is so much work left to do and I am hopeful for what the future has in store for the club.</p>
					<p>Even though I will not be the President much long, and I will not be a Rutgers Student much longer, I am still so excited to see how to club grows in the coming years. </p>
