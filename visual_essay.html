					<h2>Different Levels of Openings</h2>
					<section>
						<h3>Beginner Openings</h3>
						<p>When you are just starting to play the game, it is a good idea to pick an opening with a minimal amount of theoretical knowledge. Avoiding complex lines that require accurate play will lead to a better development of your middlegame and endgame skills. Try these openings out if you are looking for some openings to get started with.</p>
						<div class="opening_container">
							<p class="opening"><img class="opening_image" src="images/visual_essay/wayway_queen.jpeg" alt=""><strong>Wayward Queen Attack: </strong> This is one of the most common openings seen at the beginner level. However, many beginners at this level don’t know how to play against it, making it a very dangerous opening.</p>
							<p class="opening"><img class="opening_image" src="images/visual_essay/italian.jpeg" alt=""><strong>Italian Game: </strong>This is a common opening at the beginner level. This opening is very good because it is one of the oldest, tried, and tested openings in chess. </p>
							<p class="opening"><img class="opening_image" src="images/visual_essay/scandinavian.jpeg" alt=""><strong>Scandinavian Defense: </strong>This is another common opening at the beginner level. There is very limited theory for this opening, so it is a good choice if you are just getting started.</p>

						<h3>Intermediate Openings</h3>

						<h3>Advanced Openings</h3>
						<p>After you have practiced many different aspects of your chess game, you may want to adventure with some openings that are not as common to catch your opponent by surprise. These openings try to avoid commonly known theory. Try these openings out and see if you can catch them off guard.</p>
						<div class="opening_container">
							<p class="opening"><img class="opening_image" src="images/visual_essay/english.jpeg" alt=""><strong>English: </strong>The English is an unusual, but nonetheless effective opening for white. Some of the lines in the English transpose into Queen’s Gambit or Catalan theory.</p>
							<p class="opening"><img class="opening_image" src="images/visual_essay/caro_kann.jpeg" alt=""><strong>Caro-Kann Defense: </strong>The Caro-Kann Defense is similar to the French Defense for black. It is a good opening if you want to sidestep a lot of theory in other similar openings.</p>

						<p>Playing these openings in a serious game requires considerable preparation. There is a lot of theory in these lines that make the position very sharp. There are also many variations that can be tricky to navigate. These openings are very rewarding to play, often giving a sizable advantage if played correctly.</p>
